Minimalistic Countdown Timer app for iOS

Find it on the app store as Minutes Countdown Timer - I've released it here in case anyone would find it helpful.



App store description
=====================

Minimalistic, easy‑to‑use countdown timer for iPhone and iPad. Probably the world’s simplest countdown timer for touch screen devices. Never end up in a prolonged meeting again. Just set the Minutes countdown timer so all can see it to make sure everyone knows when it is time to end the meeting.

DESIGN
Minutes has been designed to have the ultimate abstract interface - 100% content and no visual interface elements. Goodbye, skeuomorphism! Hello, simplicity.

HOW IT WORKS
• Swipe to set the time
• Tap to start / pause
• Double tap to reset

ALARMS
When the countdown timer finishes and the app is open, a bell will ring. If the app is closed, a push message with an inspirational quote will appear along with the bell sound. Alarms are usually stressful, but with the inspirational quotes found in Minutes you will know when time is up without having to focus on your stress level.

USAGE
Minutes countdown timer is perfect for:
• Meetings - never host a prolonged meeting again. Set the timer and everyone will know when the meeting is over
• Keynotes and events - display a countdown on the projector via airplay so everyone will be ready for the keynote speaker
• Competitions - time the fun to raise the adrenaline
• Cooking - make sure that soufflé doesn’t burn
• Household tasks - remember to take out the laundry
• Sports - challenge yourself to beat your last run with a clear indication of your remaining time.
